# draftDay

A fantasy draft-esque client for Pokemon Showdown.

As of now, for people in the same room using the same device to
pick their players, a fantasy draft-esque couch co-op client for Pokemon Showdown.

## Future Improvements/Additions

- Automatic feedback (How many pokemon are possible with the selected parameters -> whether it's feasible with the amount of teams
selected)

- Draft rooms: multiple users drafting at the same time in the same
Draft room, different physical room
