# draftDay

A fantasy draft-esque client for Pokemon Showdown.

## How To

- User creates or joins room

- Room leader adjusts preferences that the other players can see in real time. Players will then ready up if they agree with the preferences the leader has selected. <b>The leader cannot start the draft until all players have readied up.</b>

- Once the draft has started, players will take turns selecting their teams out of the pokemon draft pool that was randomly generated based on the preferences.

- When the draft is over, each team's pokemon will be shown and ready to be copied right into pokemon showdown.

## Future Improvements/Additions

- Gen 7

- Automatic feedback (How many pokemon are possible with the selected parameters -> whether it's feasible with the amount of teams
selected)

- 'Copy to clipboard' button for teams when draft is over.

- Option to generate pokemon with moves and items.

- Leader can set cap to number of people in draft?

- Private rooms?

## Known Bugs

- Linear draft doesn't seem to be working right now
